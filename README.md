# FrequencyAnalyzer
Let's imagine that two spies decided to encrypt their correspondence using some encryption. The essence of this encryption is as follows:
each symbol is assigned to another arbitrary symbol of the alphabet, and each symbol of the original message is replaced with the replacement symbols in the text.
This program will help you to read the correspondence of these spies.

P. S. Because each cipher text is individual, it is impossible to write a program that would perform frequency analysis on its own. This requires a man.
